# Roadmap

## Phase 1: Small-object scanning
- Kinect v1/v2 support behind a clean sensor interface
- RGB-D capture to disk
- Basic calibration and frame filtering
- TSDF integration + mesh export (PLY/OBJ)
- Dimension and volume measurement

## Phase 2: Improved quality
- Better registration (ICP/feature matching)
- Surface cleanup (outlier removal, hole filling)
- Turntable workflow
- Reproducible scan presets

## Phase 3: Larger scenes
- Streaming integration for longer scans
- Memory-aware reconstruction
- Multi-scan alignment and merging
